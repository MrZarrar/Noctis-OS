Notes on the gate table above: the foundation migration file declares 25 tables; `migrate()` creates the
`schema_migrations` ledger table itself as part of applying it, so a freshly migrated database has 26
tables in total (`apps/core/src/db/migrate.test.ts` — "applies the real foundation migration and creates
all 26 tables"). The rollback gate (row 4) was validated by sabotage, not merely by reading the code:
replacing each `ROLLBACK` in `apps/core/src/db/transactions.ts` with `COMMIT` was tried locally during
development and made the corresponding THE GATE test fail on the `objectives` row count — i.e. the tests
exercise the actual rollback mechanism, not an incidental assertion that happens to pass.

The five domain state machines enumerated above are the complete set named in ADR-0006 and covered by
`packages/domain/src/state/*.test.ts`. That directory also contains `transition.test.ts`, which is not
one of the five: it tests the generic `defineTransition` helper against a two-state toy machine (`red`
-> `green`) and is not a domain transition matrix, so it is deliberately excluded from this gate's
evidence list.

## Verification log

Fresh final command evidence is appended at the end of each implementation batch. Historical success
is not treated as current evidence.

Objective status transitions, Noctis/Jarvis environment namespace isolation, and read-only donor
boundary/snapshot utilities.

The pinned Rust 1.98.0 toolchain is now verified locally. Empty integration, E2E, security, and
performance scripts are scaffolding, not evidence of scenario coverage.

### 2026-08-23 Tauri 2 bootstrap

| Command                             | Result                                                                |

| `cargo metadata --locked --no-deps` | exit 0; pinned desktop crate and targets resolve                      |
| `npm run tauri -- info`             | Rust, Cargo, MSVC, WebView2, Node, and npm detected                   |
| `npm run test:desktop-bootstrap`    | local compile blocked by enforced Smart App Control, events 3077/3033 |

The compile test first failed because the desktop manifest was absent, proving the red condition. It
then reached dependency compilation after the scaffold and locks were added, where Windows blocked
Cargo's unsigned generated `serde_json` build-script executable with OS error 4551. No App Control
setting was changed. The Windows GitHub Actions Rust job now owns compile, Clippy, test, and unbundled
Tauri-build verification; that evidence remains pending until this commit is pushed.

| `git merge feat/bootstrap-foundation` into `main`     | fast-forward `2ce90b8..bf6660c`; merged-tree checks re-run and green; pushed to `origin/main`                              |

`test:desktop-bootstrap` and `rust:test` were not re-run locally on this machine because no local Rust
toolchain is installed here; the GitHub Actions `rust` job is the authoritative check for those and it
passed.

Phase 0 is accepted. All checks above are implemented and evidenced; production deployment/activation
remains deliberately not started pending later explicit approval.

`test:desktop-bootstrap` and the Rust checks (`rust:fmt:check`, `rust:clippy`, `rust:test`,
`build:desktop`) were not run locally on this machine — no local Rust toolchain is installed here, as
was already true for every prior batch in this project. The GitHub Actions `rust` job is the
authoritative check for those, and it passed on run `33505602165`. The only CI annotation on that run
is GitHub's own deprecation notice about `actions/checkout@v4`/`actions/setup-node@v4` predating Node
20 removal; it is infrastructure noise, not a Phase 1 defect, and was left unaddressed.

The Node 22 `--experimental-sqlite` question is closed: Node 22.23.2 has `node:sqlite` unflagged, first
confirmed empirically in CI run `33453626520` (Task 1) and re-confirmed by this run, which passed
`test:migrations` — a suite that exercises `node:sqlite` directly — without `NODE_OPTIONS` set anywhere
in `.github/workflows/verify.yml` or the local shell.

Gate-to-test mapping was checked against actual test names rather than transcribed from the plan; two
corrections were needed. First, the malformed-event gate cited `events.test.ts` — "unknown name and
version" in the plan, which does not match any test name; the actual tests are "rejects an unregistered
name" and "rejects an unknown version of a registered name". Second, the rollback gate was written as
"the two tests marked THE GATE" in the plan; `apps/core/src/db/transactions.test.ts` now has three,
the third added while closing a boundary gap where a mutation could self-commit and then refuse — all
three are named above.

Phase 1 is accepted. All checklist items in the design spec's Phase 1 verification checklist are met:
local suite green, CI green on both jobs on pinned Node 22.23.2, the `node:sqlite` flag question is
answered with evidence rather than left open, and the donor repository is confirmed byte-for-byte
unchanged. Production deployment/activation remains deliberately not started pending later explicit
approval.
